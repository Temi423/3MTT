# JavaScript Assignment

This code is used to:
* Declare a new variable, city, and assign it to a value.
* Call both new variables to confirm they hold the value you believe they do
* What data type did you assign as the value in your age and city variables?
* Create three more variables, and give them each different data types (Number, String, Boolean)
* Call each variable to confirm it holds the value you believe it does
